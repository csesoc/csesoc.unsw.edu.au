        "question": "How can we help CSE students?",
        "answer": "We are a society for the students, by the students. As a CSE student, we can help you through the weekly events we run and organise; these include: trivia, movie, poker, and boardgame nights, LAN Parties, workshops, code jams, tech talks, and our famous FREE weekly BBQ. Additionally:\n- We run a highly successful First Year Camp, offering new CSE students (both undergraduate and postgraduate) a weekend of Trivia, Dance Parties, Scavenger Hunts and general frivolity with the chance to meet and mingle with other newcomers.\n- The society is entirely run by CSE student volunteers. All CSE Students are automatically members, and there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with running events and activities.\n- We cater to new and returning students alike, with a mix of events designed to have something for everyone. Events are open to all members and nearly all are free to attend.\n- We're as passionate about computing as you are; we provide technical events to teach you new skills, as well as a fortnightly magazine to keep you updated on what's new and interesting within the university, school and industry.\n\nMost of all, we're here to help you settle in and have a great time at UNSW!"
