        "question": "How can we help CSE students?",
        "answer": "We are a society for the students, by the students. As a CSE student, we can help you through the weekly events we run and organise; these include: trivia, movie, poker, and boardgame nights, LAN Parties, workshops, code jams, tech talks, and our famous FREE weekly BBQ. Additionally, we run a highly successful First Year Camp, offering new CSE students (both undergraduate and postgraduate) a weekend of Trivia, Dance Parties, Scavenger Hunts and general frivolity with the chance to meet and mingle with other newcomers. The society is entirely run by CSE student volunteers. Since all CSE Students are automatically members, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with running events and activities. We also cater to new and returning students alike, with a mix of events designed to have something for everyone. Events are open to all members and nearly all are free to attend. Finally, we're as passionate about computing as you are; we provide technical events to teach you new skills, as well as a fortnightly magazine to keep you updated on what's new and interesting within the university, school and industry. Most of all, we're here to help you settle in and have a great time at UNSW!"

        "question": "How can you get involved?",
        "answer": "The CSESoc Executive and Directors hope you have enjoyed our events and activities - so much so that you wish you had the chance to help run something yourself! If you are interested in helping out in a specific area or are thinking about running for a director/executive position in the future, then joining a subcommittee is the best way to get involved, meet other people and try something new."

    {
        "question": "How can you join a subcommittee?",
        "answer": "Watch out for our recruitment drives on Facebook, which usually happen at the start of the year. If you'd like more information or have any questions, don't hesitate to send us an enquiry below."
